## Instalation

In order to setup the solution on your premises do the following:

1. [Download and install RabbitMQ server](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html) and run service on default port. It is optional if you want to install rabbitmq management. More details you can find [here](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html)
2. Build entire solution in Visual Studio 2017 Community edition. If not installed it could be found [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) for download.
3. Select solution and click `Start` from VS2017 in order for all 3 projects to come alive! Alternatively you could just `dotnet run` for each project.

The project creates and use a LocalDB MSSQL Server named DevLear.
By the end of the execution you could delete the database completely.

Have fun!
